# The Game
Emojiball is a game where you must manage the mood of three balls in order to score points. The game encourages players to use tactics that usually don't come into play in game spaces - such as manipulating the room's brightness, shouting, and even cuddling the game pieces.

The game is played with at least three players, with one goal per player. A happy (green) ball that enters a player's goal scores the thrower one point. An angry (red) ball that enters a player's goal means the player who owns that goal has lost a point.
